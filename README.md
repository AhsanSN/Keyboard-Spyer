# Keyboard-Spyer
Runs in the background and stores all the key presses without giving a slightest clue that its recording everything.

## About

Stores the id of key presses in a text file in the 'files' folder. You can later use the 'Decode.py' to decode what is written in that text file.

The running in background totally depends on how you have built the code.
